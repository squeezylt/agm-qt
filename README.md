# agm-manager

## Summary
This is a mod manager for an anime game at it's core. This project also plans to provide simple gui tooling for mods.

## Requirements
Qt 5, Python 3

## Build instructions:
None so far. Still in testing.
If you want to run this execute the main.py file with python3

## Usage
Navigate to the settings menu. Just click the cog. Select your mod directory from here. Once a mod folder is successfully loaded, you may navigate back to the main modding page. The simplest usage of this manager is to disable or enable mods via one click. If in tree view, simply uncheck or check a mod to disable or enable. 

Have fun
